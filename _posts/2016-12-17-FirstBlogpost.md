			<p>For the first time in a long time on November 3rd, I opened up an editor and typed in a line of code. It was like sitting in the car I drove in high school (a 1988 Honda Prelude), a sense of comfort overwhelmed. I've spent much time here before, and, the further I get into it, the more I wonder why I ever left.</p>
			<p>Fast forward a few weeks, learning jQuery selectors &amp; having half of my code malfunction because of a wanton period, now I start to see why I left. In reality though, I'm starting to love the entire process. I'm starting to savor the work involved in building fully-functional, expertly-styled webpages from the ground up. It marries a sense of hard work to a tangible, visible product that I can be truly proud of, and showcase here on my portfolio. Though the work I've done through Bloc has been mostly spoon-fed thus far, I can already see the avenues by which I will become fully capable of bowling without the bumpers, as it were.</p>
			<p>I've already got a few ideas of pages &amp; apps (Thanks React Native!) that I'd like to build, and while I'll try not to let my ambition overwhelm me, it is nice to have directions to go once I have time &amp; resources to spend on myself. Of course, one of the primary goals of me enrolling at Bloc is to get a job in the tech sector to stabilize my life, but, as always, I like to use my skills to do nice things for myself, friends &amp; family.</p>
			<p>So with that, I'll wrap this up. And not just because I think the New Orleans Bowl in the background is about to be a must-watch game. Mostly I should stop rambling about myself. That's bad for my ego. Until next time, Adios.</p>
